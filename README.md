# Factory Design Pattern
The Factory Design Pattern supplies a way to obtain a concrete class without specifically creating it each time.

Factories are a great way to demonstrate how Polymorphism works.  (Think: One object, many uses.)

At its core, the consumer of the factory will only know that they're receiving a certain type of object in response to their request.  The end result is that the consumer will obtain a concrete class, without explicitly creating one themselves.

This design pattern has many applications in Object-Oriented Programming and is common to find.
